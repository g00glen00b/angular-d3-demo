AngularJS D3.js Directive
===
This demonstrative project show you how you could integrate D3.js with AngularJS by defining proper directives. In this example I wrote a directive that would be able to generate a barchart depending on the data provided.

You can view the demo ([Demo page](http://g00glen00b.github.io/angular-d3-demo/)) or you could follow the tutorial on my [blog](http://g00glen00b.be/angular-d3/).
